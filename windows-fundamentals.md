# Windows Fundamentals

- NTFS - New Technology File System
    - the newest journaling file system (older ones were FAT16/FAT32, HPFS, which are still used in usb devices, etc)
    - the file system can automatically repair folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file (not possible with FAT)
- User Account Control (UAC) - when an administrator logs into a system, it doesn't actually run with elevated permissions and instead will prompt you to
  confirm running a higher operation

### Ctrl+Shift+Esc - opens Task Manager
